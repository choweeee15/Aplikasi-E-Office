My responsibility as a First Officer/Co-Pilot is handling the Flight control example like the gears, lights flaps, navigation, doors and etc.

The responsibility as a captain is piloting the plane and are responsible for the safety of everyone on board.

The rank captain+ can get a test flight.

I need to have atleast 2 test flights to be able to pilot a flight.

The rank VP (Vice President) can give a test flight.
