My responsibility as a First Officer/Co-Pilot is handling the Flight control example like the gears, lights flaps, navigation, doors and etc.

It's true. Navigation lights should be at all times.

Gears= Bring them up after takeoff and before landing, Taxi lights= when taxiing, ignition= always, Spoilers= right after landing.



The Nav Lights, ignition.
